## Demonstration of Topic Model with LDA

This demonstration is mainly a fork from 

> [https://github.com/kapadias/mediumposts/blob/master/nlp/published_notebooks/Introduction%20to%20Topic%20Modeling.ipynb](https://github.com/kapadias/mediumposts/blob/master/nlp/published_notebooks/Introduction%20to%20Topic%20Modeling.ipynb)

with the following modification

- barplot using matplotlib instead of seaborn
- classification of all "documents" using the trained LDA model
- illustration of the title of "documents" belonging toa specific topic
